Templates Panel
=================

Templates are cool. Templates help you. This is how.

You can use templates to organize things that you often find yourself repeating when you create a diagram. You arrange these elements just how you want them in a diagram 'template' and
then just drag that template onto a working diagram when you need it.

For example, perhaps there's a certain arrangement of business shapes you use quite often. Or perhaps some text stuff that
you put at the top of every diagram. These kinds of things go into a template.

Template Panel
--------------------

Templates libraries are stored in the **Templates** panel, similar to shapes and backgrounds. In fact, you can export template libraries just like shape and background libraries.

To show the **Templates** panel, click the "Templates" button, |template-button| third one down in the right-hand navigation. Or press F3. You should see something like this:

There's always a "Default Templates" library, which will be empty when you first start. You can add lots of templates to this default library,
or create a bunch of different template libraries and put templates in each of those, just like you do with shape or background libraries.

But you can't delete the **Default Templates** library, because then you might not know what's going on and send me an email like "aaahh aaahh help
what do I do?" and I'd say "create a new Templates library" and you'd be like "Whaaat? Whaat? Ahhhh I'm in hell..." and so on, and nobody wants that. So
you'll always have a **Default Templates** library.



Creating a New Template Library
--------------------------------

To create a new template library, select **Libraries** > **New custom library** from the menu, and then enter a new libray name and make sure to set type to "Templates" and not shapes or backgrounds.

Adding a New Template
--------------------------------

You can create a new template in your library by right- or shift-clicking anywhere in the template library and selecting "Create template":

.. figure:: /_static/images/template-context-create.jpg

Right away, you'll notice a green bar beneath and to the left of your diagram. This means you're in **Template Mode**. Whatever you do in your diagram work area now will be saved to the template you're creating.

Template Properties
--------------------------------

Click the "Template Properties" button in that green bar to modify how your template behaves later on when you apply it to one of your diagrams. The options on this panel are pretty self explanatory...

Adding Things to your Template
---------------------------------

Ok this is where things get interesting.
