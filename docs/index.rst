   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

Welcome to the SimpleDiagrams Super Simple Docs
========================================================
This document is my attempt to explain to you how best to use SimpleDiagrams.
Ideally, you shouldn't even be here since it should have been easy to figure out
what you wanted to do. Alas, here you are. Therefore I'll try to get you back to
being productive with the app as quickly as possible.

Skip to the :ref:`quick-start` page if this much help text has already made you cranky.
