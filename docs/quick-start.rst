Quick Start
===========

You've only got ten minutes, and you've got your priorities straight because half of that time is going to be
spent on making your coffee just right. Spend the rest of that time here and you'll get a no frills run-down on
how to use SimpleD. Then come back to the other docs when you need more help or want to become a power user, because in
the end everyone wants to be a power user.
