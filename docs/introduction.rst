Introduction
============

The last thing you need is one more complicated tool vying for your time and precious brain
cycles. SimpleDiagrams wants to help you make the sketches, diagrams and visualizations you need
with the minimum amount of time spent learning how to use the interface.

There's nothing stopping you from just firing it up and going to town. However, if you're the
cautious and sensitive type (aren't we all, really) you'd probably appreciate a friendly introduction to how SD
works and what kinds of neat things you can do with the app. These docs are for you.

You might also be somewhat of a tech geek, and want to figure out how you can twist SimpleD to your own
machinations. These docs are also for you, you just have to go farther down the table of contents to find
stuff like how libraries are made, how you can create your own SimpleD-ready SVG shapes, etc. etc.
