Helpers
========================
Helper are small things that help you. I call them helpers because I'm not sure what else to call them.
They are all found under the view menu and they'll always be there for you.

Quick Navigation
--------------------
This small box let's you see your whole diagram in miniature. The blue rectangle in the box shows you the current
viewable area. Drag that blue box around to zip around your diagram. Much better than scrollbars.

To show/hide:

Mac OS: cmd-SHIFT-Q
PC: ctrl-SHIFT-Q

Grid
--------------------

The grid helper just shows a grid on top of whatever you're doing. You can choose to snap
objects to it, or just use it for a visual guide.

To control the line color, size  of the cells, and whether the grid is in front or behind your stuff,
use the grid properties dialog ( *View* > *Grid properties* )

To show/hide the grid:

Mac OS: cmd-'   (single-quote)
PC: ctrl-'   (single quote)

To enabled/disable snap to grid:

Mac OS: cmd-SHIFT-'   (single-quote)
PC: ctrl-SHIFT-'   (single quote)


Rulers
---------------------

Rulers help you see where your stuff is. They're not so powerful yet because you can't drag out guides, but we'll get to that eventually.
Rules will update their units based on the units you set when you created the document: pixels, feet or meters.

To show/hide rulers:

Mac OS: cmd-R
PC: ctrl-R


Quick Styles
---------------------

Quick styles is place for your to save certain stroke and fill styles while you're working on your diagram.
It has six boxes to store six styles:

The way it works is, you just eyedrop a shape that has a style you'll be using a lot. Then, click an
empty box in the quick styles dialog. That box will save your style. Whenever you want to use it,
just click it with an empty eyedropper.

If you want to change that box later, just drop a new style on it from a full eyedropper.

To show/hide Quick Styles:

Mac OS: cmd-K
PC: ctrl-K
