Using Presentation Mode
=====================

Presentation mode is a way of launching a separate window for your SimpleDiagram that you might want to use when explaining something
during a screencast, skype session or so on. It's a simple view of your diagram, without any toolbars or panels cluttering the space.
Also, there's a few helpful tools that make it easier to talk about the diagram, like a pencil that fades after you've used it.
